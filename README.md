# RGB-Color-Match
An iOS game to match colors using the red-green-blue color model. This helped me learn SwiftUI, and I took code as a starter from this page: https://www.raywenderlich.com/3715234-swiftui-getting-started 

This app was on the app store at one point, but I cancelled my Apple Developer membership so now it's not.
